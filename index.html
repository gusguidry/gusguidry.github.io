    Welcome traveler. Sorry, my blog is taking a nap. I'll get around to fixing it... In due time.

    If you are sitting there thinking, 'Wow, this is unprofessional. One HTML file for a homepage? I was hoping for a 20 MiB showcase of animated JavaScript bloatware,' please feel free to submit your formal complaints to <a href="mailto:gus@gusguidry.com">gus@gusguidry.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
    Or, you could cry about it to your mom.
